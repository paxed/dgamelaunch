* Only the first 15 games in progress are shown on the games in progress
screen.

* Since virus kept calling alarm() on itself, I removed SIGALRM handling
altogether, which breaks occasional refresh of the bottom status line.
I don't consider this a huge bug, but if one day I, or someone else, 
gets really bored, the full solution to this would be to bring back
the virus signal handling, and just clear the alarm calls before exiting
and going back to dgamelaunch code (or clear the alarm() handlers).
