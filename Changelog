1.4.1 (2004/02/13)
	* Call fcntl with F_SETLK, not F_UNLCK.
	* Make sure writefile does not get called when using it as a
	  password prompt for new-users
	* Allow user to change his or her email address in the console.
	* Remove some useless cruft in ttywait() [ttyplay.c]

1.4 (2004/02/03)
	* Major cleanups - remove most uses of strcpy() and strcat()
	* A number of virus bugs have been fixed regarding getopt() and
	  other minor issues.
	* Add support for mailing users while they are playing.
	  [nh343-simple_mail.diff is needed]
	* Add a confirmation to the change password screen so people like me
	  don't change their passwords by accident all the time.
	* Remove many unused variables and make some functions void because
	  they don't return anything.
	* Add some function prototypes in dgamelaunch.c to quell warnings.
	* Make some vars unsigned to quell warnings.
	* 'capital letter. experimental' section made irrelevant by use of
	  tolower(3) around getch()
	* Change big conditional block to use a switch.
	* Replace a global with a static variable within the function.
	* Replace the giant size 64000 static buffers with dynamically
	  allocated structs
	* Checking for colons in user fields is made simpler using strstr(3)
	* Allow page up and page down on the watch games menu
	* Merge BSD compatibility patches
	* All licenses in source code mentioned in COPYING
	* Use fcntl for all file locking; flock(3) is not portable
	* Fix some troublesome uses of strncpy() with strlcpy
	* ditto for strncat->strlcat
	* Make sure only one session can be played at once at all and
	  SIGHUP the rest, ensuring the death of "Destroy old game? [yn]"
	* Replace two colossal conditionals with calls to isalnum(3).
	* Shift from static #defines to a configuration file system
	  powered by lex/yacc.
	* Include a little stub program to test dgamelaunch's functionality
	  without actually going through the hassle of setting up Nethack.
	* Always use -lcurses and #include <curses.h>
	* Port to FreeBSD 5 and Solaris (as of yet, untested)
	* Switched to own version of getnstr() that always accepts both
	  ^H and ^?
	* Now use 'ee' as the default rcfile editor. virus is still a compile
	  time option - see README for details.
	* A giant code cleanup that centralizes necessary globals, removes
	  unnecessary variables and #defines...
	* Improved stripgfx feature to allow in-session graphic strip
	  toggling. Still a bit unreliable though, but works better than
	  before.

1.3.10 (2003/10/22)
	* Added a mode flag to the open call for inprogress lock files.
	  (jilles)

1.3.9 (2003/09/06)
	* Fixed the bug where editing options file wouldn't work on same
	  session as registration.
	* Changed ttyplay timeout to 20 minutes with a better error msg.
	* Made a zero length response on registration just dump you
	  back to the main menu.

1.3.7 (2003/09/06)
	* Fixed the infamous hlen bug! I was rewinding to the beginning
	  of payload, not header. 

1.3.5 (2003/09/05)
	* Returned SIGWINCH to defaults after exiting virus. This was
	  probably the screen resize crash bug. (maybe?)

1.3.1 (2003/08/30)
	* First shot at an engine to strip out graphics sets. It is a lot
	  harder than I would have thought, but doable at a 99% or so
		success rate, I think, which should at least allow people to
		view games in other graphics sets somewhat.

1.2.22 (2003/08/29)
	* Expanded README
	* Hope to have caught the error in a partial read of the error.

1.2.21 (2003/08/28)
	* Added a README since I noticed people were downloading this.

1.2.20 (2003/08/24)
	* Added additional check on payload length. Just a sanity thing.

1.2.19 (2003/08/24)
	* Fixed (hopefully) that nasty bug that occurs when a partial read
	  after header read returned, and caused the next header read to
		basically read random data (and thus a random length).

1.2.18 (2003/08/14)
	* After determining select() on files sucks ass, I've just reduced
		the polling interval on the ttyplay engine to 100ms, and given
		up on an otherwise proper select call. Humans shouldn't notice
		the latency, but I always will... grrr...

1.2.17 (2003/08/14)
	* Put in the 50ms delay from header read until payload read during
	  preads in order to hopefully hack/wait around the race condition
		99% of the time.
	* Added a sleep(10) after receiving SIGHUP until sending one
	  to the child process in the mild hopes that this gets around
		whatever condition is causing it not to receive and handle 
		the SIGHUP now.

1.2.16 (2003/08/14)
	* All code is now run through indent(1) for cleanliness
	* Game playback in progress now finds the last term reset and plays
	  forward from the last header before that reset.
	* Some effort has been made to trap SIGHUP better and pass that 
	  along to child processes as well. This still needs work for
		nethack itself, but dgamelaunch is clean so far.

1.2.6 (2003/08/08)
	* Viewing games in progress now works pretty well.

1.2.0beta2 (2003/08/07)
	* Added initial ttyrec integration, although everything is very
	  broken at this point. Once I learn more about tty libraries than
		I ever want to know, maybe everything will work again.

1.1.6 (2003/08/06)
	* The last few revs included minor bugfixes found in production use,
	  changed some text in the program, and 1.1.6 is some minor packaging
		changes for the purposes of a release to the public of the source
		code.

1.1.1 (2003/08/02)
  * Introduced virus (vi editor) code, and provided a new option to edit
	  personal nethack rc files.

1.0.0 (2003/08/01)
	* Since 0.2.3 has been in production for over a year and a half, it
	  is hereby dubbed 1.0.0.

0.2.2 (2001/11/11)
  * added change password feature. also is the way to get password crypt()ed

0.2.1 (2001/11/11)
  * moved more of the crucial config into defines
  * removed the echo of password on login

0.2.0 (2001/11/11)
  * added crypt() support for the password file. Now the program first
    checks for the crypt() password, then the plaintext one for legacy
    and for ease of admins changing passwords.
