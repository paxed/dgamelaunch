-add new config file commands:
  -chpasswd       (change user's password)
  -chmail         (change user's email address)
  -watch_menu     (go to the watching menu)
  -login          (login user)
  -newuser        (register new user)
  -quit           (quit from dgl)
  -game_menu "x"  (go to game menu "x")
  -return         (return to main menu)
  -start_game     (start the selected game)

-maybe allow new menu options configurable in config file, like
 commands['O', "Edit config file with foo"] = exec "foo" "rcfile"

 OR:

 menu "mainmenu_anon" {
     option {
        keys = 'l'
	name = "l) Login"
        commands = login
     }
     option {
        keys = 'r'
        name = "r) Register new user"
	commands = newuser
	flags = allow_new_nicks
     }
     option {
        keys = 'w'
	name = "w) Watch games in progress"
        commands = watch_menu
     }
     emptyline
     option {
	keys = 'q', 'Q'
	name = "q) Quit"
	commands = quit
     }
 }

 possibly adding a location = (x,y) key into menu option, allowing
 absolute positioning of the option.


 OR: (this looks nicer, but requires also editing the external text files)

 menu "mainmenu_anon" {
	banner = "dglmenu_main_anon.txt"
	cursor = (x,y)
	commands['l'] = login
	commands['r'] = newuser
	commands['w'] = watch_menu
	commands['q'] = quit
 }

 menu "mainmenu_loggedin" {
	banner = "dglmenu_main_loggedin.txt"
	cursor = (x,y)
	commands['c'] = chpasswd
	commands['e'] = chmail
	commands['w'] = watch_menu
	commands['q', 'Q'] = quit
	commands['1'] = game_menu "NH343"
	commands['2'] = game_menu "Crxxx"
	commands['3'] = game_menu "NhStb"
 }

 and the game submenus?

 define {
    blahblahblah game data here
    short_name = "NH343"
    menu {
      banner = "dglmenu_game_nh343.txt"
      cursor = (x,y)
      commands['c'] = chpasswd
      commands['e'] = chmail
      commands['w'] = watch_menu
      commands['o'] = exec "virus" "%rrcfiles/%n.nethackrc"
      commands['q'] = return
      commands['p'] =   # back up savefile
      		      commands = cp "/var/games/nethack/save/%u%n.gz" "/var/games/nethack/save/%u%n.gz.bak",
		        # set NETHACKOPTIONS to point to the rcfile
             	      setenv "NETHACKOPTIONS" "@%rrcfiles/%n.nethackrc",
		        # set up nethack mail stuff, assuming it's compiled with it...
                      setenv "MAIL" "/var/mail/%n",
                      setenv "SIMPLEMAIL" "1",
		        # don't let the mail file grow
                      unlink "/var/mail/%n",
		        # aannnd we're off!
		      start_game
    }
 }

 and maybe allow changing the watching-screen layout too?


-allow setting the default watch-screen sortmode in config file.
-some games (robotfindskitten?) are not worth saving into ttyrecs, make it configurable.
-allow configuring ttyplay.c; some games may use different clear-screen
 commands. (see for example crawl)
-return back to dgl after exiting the game. (on NAO, the dgl processes
 take 33m+ resident memory, so might not be viable unless we use sqlite3)
-public (no-password) accounts? (a per-user flag) what happens when someone
 is playing on the account and someone else logins and we start playing?
-change the watching screen not to show the 'press 'm' to mail user'
 part, if spool isn't enabled.
-info screen (more than just the banner), for info about the game(s)
 and the server, etc.
-allow more than one editor per dgl
-allow users to run recover themselves
-make dgl show # of watchers
-configurable stuff: allowed chars in usernames,
 allow char stripping, ...

- Flags for operators/staff/admins or (optionally) user-bans.

- Localization of variables, code clean up

- Use /var/run/nologin and/or dgl-specific nologin file

- Honor window size changes (currently the player has to relogin if window
  size changes)
