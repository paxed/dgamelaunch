# This is a sample dgamelaunch configuration file. Only bash-style comments
# are allowed, such as this. Each configuration option will be explained
# along with its default value. 

# The following two options are fairly insecure. They will force us to 
# load the password/group database into memory while still having root
# privileges. Replace them with shed_uid/shed_gid entries as soon as
# possible if you decide to use them. dgamelaunch will inform you of
# the uids/gids corresponding to your choices when it loads.
#
# Note that shed_uid and shed_gid will always take precedence over
# shed_user and shed_group if they are specified.

# shed_user: username to shed privileges to
shed_user = "games"
# shed_group: group name to shed privileges to
shed_group = "games"

# Preferably, you may use the respective gids/uids. This is for Debian:
shed_uid = 5
shed_gid = 60

# Max amount of registered users to allow.
maxusers = 64000

# From inside the jail, where dgamelaunch should put mail - should match up with
# NetHack settings.
spooldir = "/var/mail/"

# From inside the jail, location of a banner file that contains no more than
# 14 lines of 80-column width text. Any more will be truncated.

# that stores the user database, and lockfile is only used internally by
# dgamelaunch.

# From inside the jail, the path to the savefile. %u is replaced by the
# decimal representation of shed_uid, %n is replaced by the player's
# user name. Before starting the game, this file is copied to its name
# with ".bak" appended. Set to an empty string to disable this copying.
